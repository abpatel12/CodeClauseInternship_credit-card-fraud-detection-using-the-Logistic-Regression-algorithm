This project focuses on implementing a credit card fraud detection system for Ceresiti using the Logistic Regression algorithm. The dataset utilized is sourced from Kaggle, specifically the "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset. This dataset consists of credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. The project encompasses essential steps such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the application of Logistic Regression for fraud detection.

## Project Highlights:
- Utilizes Logistic Regression for effective fraud detection.
- Leverages a Kaggle dataset containing real-world credit card transactions.
- Incorporates preprocessing techniques to enhance data quality and relevance.
- Explores feature engineering methods to improve model performance.
- Provides an in-depth analysis and evaluation of the Logistic Regression model's effectiveness in identifying fraudulent transactions.

## Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/ceresiti-card-fraud-detection.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r stramlit.txt`
3. Download the Kaggle dataset and place it in the `creditcard.csv` directory.

## Usage:
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook Ceresiti_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb`
2. Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to train, evaluate, and analyze the Logistic Regression model.
